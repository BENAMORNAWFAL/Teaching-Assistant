1. Introduction to OOP:

Definition: Explain that Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that uses objects, 
which bundle data and methods that operate on the data, to design and build software.
Key Concepts: Discuss key OOP concepts such as encapsulationالتغليف, inheritanceالميراث, and polymorphismتعدد الأشكال.
التعريف: اشرح أن البرمجة كائنية التوجه هي نموذج يستخدم الكائنات، التي تجمع البيانات والأساليب التي تعمل على البيانات، لتصميم وبناء البرامج.
المفاهيم الأساسية: مناقشة مفاهيم OOP الأساسية مثل التغليف والميراث وتعدد الأشكال.

2. Classes and Objects:
Class Definition: Introduce the concept of a class as a blueprint for objects. It defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
Object Creation: Explain how objects are instances of classes, and demonstrate how to create objects.
3. Inheritance:
Definition: Describe inheritance as a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class.
Superclass and Subclass: Introduce the terms superclass (parent class) and subclass (child class). Explain that a subclass can extend the functionality of its superclass.
Example: Provide a simple example, such as a Vehicle superclass with Car and Motorcycle subclasses.
4. Abstract Classes:
Abstract Class Definition: Introduce abstract classes as classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and may contain abstract methods.
Abstract Methods: Explain abstract methods as methods without a body. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations.
Use Case: Provide an example, such as an abstract class Shape with abstract method calculateArea, and subclasses like Circle and Square that implement it.
5. Interfaces:
Interface Definition: Describe interfaces as a collection of abstract methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
Implementation: Explain that a class implementing an interface must provide concrete implementations for all interface methods.
Example: Demonstrate an interface Drawable with a method draw(). Classes like Circle and Square can implement this interface.
6. Putting it All Together:
Real-world Example: Create a real-world scenario, such as a ShowRoom with different types of vehicles. Use classes, inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces to model this scenario.
Code Walkthrough: Walk through a simple Java program that showcases these concepts. Use comments to explain each section.
7. Hands-On Exercises:
Coding Exercises: Provide hands-on coding exercises where students can practice creating classes, implementing interfaces, and using inheritance.
8. Questions and Discussions:
Encourage Questions: Encourage students to ask questions and engage in discussions.
Real-world Examples: Discuss real-world examples where OOP concepts are applied.
9. Practice Projects:
Project Assignments: Assign projects that require students to apply OOP concepts to solve real-world problems.
10. Review and Assessment:
Assessment: Evaluate students through quizzes, assignments, and projects to ensure understanding.
